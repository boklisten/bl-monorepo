# bl-monorepo

# TODOs:

- Update READMEs
- check if Typescript rules are strict enough
- Check if TS configs have correct targets and versions
- Update deployments to use bl-monorepo
- Archive bl-next and bl-api if all deployments works
- Keep bl-model on both Github and NPM until bl-web and bl-admin are migrated to bl-monorepo
